## Contributing

You can add new features to this project by forking it. If you don't have an idea, you can choose from the [TODO](TODO.md) section and work to make this project bigger.

You Can see The [tree-like path of the Blog](./Tree.md).

For local development, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is preferred as package manager:

```bash
npm install

npm run serve
```

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as optional chaining.
